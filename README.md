# WorkBase - Work Schedule Web Application - CS441

Authors: Chrisitan Gordon, Chihiro Nishijima, Kristina Reinhart, Monica Rocha, Peter Sharp

REPOSITORY USAGE
- clone repository to local machine 
- make changes on local copy of repository
- before pushing back to main branch, call out changes in CS441/group2 discord to avoid merge conflicts
  (ex. I made changes on login page and calendar page. pushing to main branch now)
- remember to pull from main branch to get most up to date changes.
  (note. if you have local changes that are not reflected on the main branch 
   and need to pull to get more up to date remote changes from main branch,
   first push your changes, then pull all changes from main)

- IF IN DOUBT REACH OUT
